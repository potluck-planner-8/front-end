## Description

Tired of being the 3rd guy at a potluck dinner to show up with a bowl of vegan chili? So were we! But not anymore, thanks to the Potluck Planner 8! Now you can attend a potluck dinner without the social stress of wondering whether or not your Canadian fried chicken pancakes will be judged against those of your friends and neighbors, or create a potluck of your own without the nerve-wracking possibility of all hell breaking loose at your Elks Lodge chapter because no one brought any bourbon!! 

With the Potluck Planner 8, you can 
* [ ] Create an event;
* [ ] Micromanage your friends’ and loved ones’ participation therein by clearly delineating what they can and cannot bring to it; 
* [ ] And even implement virtual punishments on those who disobey your edicts, in the form of a Shame Button™ that you can use after each event to publicize which guests failed to comply with Potluck Protocols!!! 

And if you’re invited as a guest to a Potluck Planner 8 event, the app enables you to 
* [ ] Request your host’s permission to bring a dish of your choosing (while leaving the sole and arbitrary discretion over that decision in the hands of your host); 
* [ ] And requires you to indicate whether or not you’ll attend. Potluck Forever!!!
